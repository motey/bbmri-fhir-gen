## Usage

```
$ bbmri-fhir-gen
Usage:
  bbmri-fhir-gen [directory] [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help          help for bbmri-fhir-gen
  -n, --num int       number of patients to generate (default 100)
  -s, --start int     patient index to start with
      --tx-size int   number of patients per transaction (default 100)
      --version       version for bbmri-fhir-gen
```

The generator will generate FHIR transaction bundles in JSON format and put each bundle as file in the directory specified. The defaults will generate one transaction bundle called `biobank.json` with biobank and collection resources and one transaction bundle called `transaction-0.json` with 100 patients. If you specify a total number (-n) higher than 100, more than one file will be generated. You can generate additional patients with new identifiers by specifying a custom start value (-s).
